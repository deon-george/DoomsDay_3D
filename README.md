🔥 DoomsDay 3D – Demon Maze Edition

DoomsDay 3D is a retro-style FPS built with Python and Pygame.
You’re trapped inside a cursed underworld maze — a twisting hellscape carved from molten stone, ancient runes, and infernal metal. The halls burn with demonic energy, and the only thing waiting in the shadows is death.

There is no infection.
No virus mutation.
No mastermind.
Just you versus the demons of the deep maze.

Survive as long as you can.

😈 The Demon Maze

The maze is an ancient hellscape:

Charred rock walls covered in glowing runes

A blood-red sky burning above

Cracks leaking molten light beneath your feet

Hellfire torches lighting the corridors

Echoes of demons roaring through the halls

There is no exit — only survival.
Push deeper. Fight harder. How long can you last?

👿 Enemies
Lesser Demons

Twisted humanoid horrors.
Slow alone — deadly in packs.
They charge aggressively if cornered.

Greater Fiends

Massive horned beasts of molten bone and flame.
Erratic movement, heavy damage.
Their fiery glow reveals them from far away.

Enemies spawn endlessly as you progress.
The deeper you go, the worse it gets.

🎯 Objective

Survive and eliminate as many demons as possible.
No final boss.
No controller enemy.
Just you and the hellspawn.

Clear the required number of demons → You Win
Lose all HP → Game Over

🔫 Weapons
Rifle

Your starting weapon — basic but reliable.

Machine Gun

Unlocked after surviving long enough.
Higher damage, faster fire rate, better survival chances.
