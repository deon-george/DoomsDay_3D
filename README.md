DoomDay_3D-Game

DoomsDay 3D is a retro FPS built with Python and Pygame, featuring a DOOM-style raycasting engine, animated enemies, massive virus creatures, dynamic lighting, and a high-intensity bio-lab survival theme.

🎮 Features

🔥 Fast DOOM/Wolfenstein-style raycasting 3D engine

🧟‍♂️ Zombies hunting you through the maze

🦠 Giant virus monsters that glow and attack on sight

👿 A corrupted Mastermind Boss controlling the infection

🔫 Weapons system: Rifle → Machine Gun after defeating the boss

💡 Dynamic lighting, shading & DOOM-style UI

🗺 Maze exploration gameplay with no doors — just corridors, walls, and enemies

❤️ HUD: health %, lives, kills

😵 Win/Lose blur screens

🎨 Custom sprites, textures, animations, and sounds

🧪 Theme: A Cursed Bio-Lab Maze

Based on your screenshot, the environment has a dark industrial vibe:

Mold-covered walls 🧱

Hellish sky glowing in orange 🔥

Ancient demonic carvings 👹

Neon-green toxic flames ☣️

The maze isn’t just abandoned… it’s infected.
Zombies wander blindly, while giant virus blobs mutate in the shadows. The Mastermind Boss — a twisted hybrid of demon and bio-weapon — spreads the infection deeper into the facility.

Your mission: fight through the infected maze, destroy the Mastermind, and end the outbreak.

🎯 New Game Objective

💀 Kill the Mastermind Boss to win the game.
There is no exit door, no fancy entrance animation — you’re thrown straight into the maze, and the only way out…

…is to eliminate the source of the infection.

After killing the boss:

💥 You get a machine gun

👿 Enemy spawns double

🧟‍♂️ Zombies + 🦠 virus creatures keep coming

🏆 Win screen appears once the Mastermind falls

🧟‍♂️🦠 Enemies
Zombies

Slow but deadly in groups — they overwhelm you if cornered.

Virus Monsters

Large glowing blobs that move erratically and deal heavy damage.
Their size + bright toxic color makes them visible even from distance.

The Mastermind

A mutated demon-virus hybrid.
High HP, aggressive pathfinding, powerful attacks.

Defeat him → Game Won.
