💀 Dies Fatum 3D A KD Company Production

Dies Fatum 3D (Latin for The Doom Day) is a retro FPS built with Python and Pygame, featuring a classic raycasting engine, demonic creatures, toxic bio-lab environments, dynamic lighting, and a relentless survival atmosphere.

Developed by KD Company (Karthik & Deon) for GAME JAM 2025 (Coding Club TKMCE).

The maze isn’t empty — it’s cursed. Dies Fatum 3D throws you into a decaying bio-lab where ancient demonic carvings mix with glowing toxic waste. Strange creatures roam the corridors. Shadows move even when nothing should be there.

Your only goal: survive long enough to earn victory.
